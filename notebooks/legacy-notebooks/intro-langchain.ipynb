However,\\nit remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn\\nfrom trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require exten-\\nsive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion , a\\nnovel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but in-\\nstead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect\\non task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic\\nmemory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is\\nflexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language)\\nand sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains\\nsignificant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential\\ndecision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a\\n91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previ-\\nous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis\\nstudies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent\\ntypes, and provide insights into how they affect performance. We release all code,\\ndemos, and datasets at https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent works such as ReAct [ 30], SayCan [ 1], Toolformer [ 22], HuggingGPT [ 23], generative\\nagents [ 19], and WebGPT [ 17] have demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous decision-making\\nagents that are built on top of a large language model (LLM) core. These methods use LLMs to\\ngenerate text and â€˜actionsâ€˜ that can be used in API calls and executed in an environment. Since\\nthey rely on massive models with an enormous number of parameters, such approaches have been\\nso far limited to using in-context examples as a way of teaching the agents, since more traditional\\noptimization schemes like reinforcement learning with gradient descent require substantial amounts\\nof compute and time.\\nPreprint.

       " Document(metadata={'source': './assets-resources/2303.11366.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='In this paper, we propose an alternative approach called Reflexion that uses verbal reinforcement\\nto help agents learn from prior failings. Reflexion converts binary or scalar feedback from the\\nenvironment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional\\ncontext for the LLM agent in the next episode. This self-reflective feedback acts as a â€˜semanticâ€™\\ngradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn\\nfrom prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to\\naccomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner â€“ by reflecting on their previous failures in order to\\nform an improved plan of attack for the next attempt. For example, in figure 1, a Reflexion agent\\nlearns to optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks\\nthrough trial, error, and self-reflection.\\nGenerating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where\\nthe model made mistakes (i.e. the credit assignment problem [ 25]) as well as the ability to generate\\na summary containing actionable insights for improvement. We explore three ways for doing\\nthis â€“ simple binary environment feedback, pre-defined heuristics for common failure cases, and\\nself-evaluation such as binary classification using LLMs (decision-making) or self-written unit\\ntests (programming). In all implementations, the evaluation signal is amplified to natural language\\nexperience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.\\nReflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-\\nbased learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesnâ€™t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more\\nnuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards\\nthat are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and\\ninterpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints\\nfor actions in future episodes. At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the\\npower of the LLMâ€™s self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for\\nsuccess. However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.\\nWe perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long\\ntrajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation improvement,\\nand (3) programming tasks to teach the agent to effectively use external tools such as compilers\\nand interpreters. Across all three types of tasks, we observe Reflexion agents are better decision-\\nmakers, reasoners, and programmers. More concretely, Reflexion agents improve on decision-making\\nAlfWorld [ 24] tasks over strong baseline approaches by an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning\\nsteps, and on reasoning questions in HotPotQA [ 28] by 20%, and Python programming tasks on\\nHumanEval [6] by as much as 11%.\\nTo summarize, our contributions are the following:\\nâ€¢We propose Reflexion, a new paradigm for â€˜verbalâ€˜ reinforcement that parameterizes a\\npolicy as an agentâ€™s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.\\nâ€¢We explore this emergent property of self-reflection in LLMs and empirically show that\\nself-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.\\nâ€¢We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting of 40\\nchallenging Leetcode questions (â€˜hard-levelâ€˜) in 19 programming languages.\\nâ€¢We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks,\\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.\\n2 Related work\\nReasoning and decision-making Self-Refine [ 15] employs an iterative framework for self-\\nrefinement to autonomously improve generation through self-evaluation. These self-evaluation\\nand self-improvement steps are conditioned on given task constraints, such as \"How can this genera-\\ntion be written in a more positive way\". Self-Refine is effective but is limited to single-generation\\nreasoning tasks. Pryzant et al. [21] performs a similar semantic prompt-writing optimization, but is\\nalso limited to single-generation tasks. Paul et al. [20] fine-tune critic models to provide intermediate\\nfeedback within trajectories to improve reasoning responses. Xie et al. [27] use stochastic beam\\nsearch over actions to perform a more efficient decision-making search strategy which allows the\\nagent to use foresight advantage due to its self-evaluation component.

    "LangChain is an open-source framework designed to streamline the development of applications that integrate large language models (LLMs) into workflows. Built for developers who need to manage complex interactions between LLMs and various data sources, LangChain simplifies creating intelligent applications by organizing key components, like prompt templates, chains, and memory. This modular structure allows developers to select specific parts, reducing redundancy and enhancing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of LangChain's core purposes is to help developers connect LLMs with external tools, data sources, and APIs, allowing the models to execute tasks based on dynamic, contextual information. It provides seamless integrations with data sources such as SQL databases, vector databases, and document stores, empowering applications to use real-world data rather than static prompts. LangChain also supports memory functions, enabling models to recall past interactions, making it ideal for conversational applications. By automating workflows and simplifying LLM interactions, LangChain expands AIâ€™s practical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChainâ€™s modular design also enables developers to experiment with different prompt strategies and refine them for specific applications, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of language models in varied scenarios. By separating tasks like prompt engineering, chaining, and memory management, LangChain promotes a clearer, more efficient workflow for building LLM-powered systems. This framework also encourages an iterative approach to prompt design, allowing developers to adjust language models in response to real-time feedback or evolving user requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, LangChain is equipped with advanced chaining mechanisms that support multi-step tasks, ideal for applications requiring nuanced, context-sensitive responses. For example, in customer support or research assistant applications, LangChain enables chains that carry forward context from one step to the next, resulting in more cohesive and helpful responses. By leveraging tools like vector stores for memory, LangChainâ€™s chains maintain a coherent narrative across interactions, positioning the framework as a critical tool for building AI that understands and adapts within complex environments.\n",
