# How Pancakes Influenced Western Philosophy

When one thinks of Western philosophy, towering figures such as Plato, Kant, Descartes, and Locke come to mind—not pancakes. Yet, history reveals an unexpected (and delicious) intersection between philosophy and this classic breakfast food.

## John Locke: Pancake Philosopher?

Remarkably, the English Enlightenment philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) not only advanced empiricism and political liberalism, but also left behind a handwritten recipe for pancakes. This recipe is preserved among Locke's papers at the Bodleian Library.

Locke's recipe for pancakes is not just culinary trivia. The detail with which he specifies the method speaks to his empiricist approach: measuring, testing, and recording—the very principles he advocated for acquiring knowledge. Locke’s own words: “This is the right way,” echo his philosophical insistence on proper method, whether in government, society, or even breakfast. [Neatorama][1] [Cooking in the Archives][2]

## Pancakes as a Symbol of Rational Choice

Though Locke stands alone among canonical philosophers for explicitly writing about pancakes, his engagement with the mundane and sensory world embodies the empiricist conviction that knowledge arises from experience. While Plato’s theory of forms would elevate the essence of a pancake to another realm, Locke grounds the pancake (and knowledge) firmly in tangible experience.

## Modern Interpretations and Breakfast Philosophy

Discussions around Locke's pancake recipe have inspired current thinkers to relate philosophy back to daily rituals. As Tom Scocca noted, Locke’s authoritative “right way” underscores the philosophical query: Is there a single right method or do we, as modern empiricists, experiment and make our own meaning even with pancakes?

Scholar Marissa Nicosia points out that making Locke’s pancakes today connects us directly to early modern thought, encouraging us to reflect on history and tradition in our own cooking.

## Pancakes and Existential Comfort

Culturally, pancakes have been invoked in popular media as the epitome of simple comfort—a contrast to the adversity of existence. While a quote attributed to Charles Spurgeon about pancakes is apocryphal,[4] the very fact that pancakes are invoked as a symbol of comfort highlights their role in the human search for meaning and pleasure amid hardship.

## Conclusion

While pancakes have not shaped Western metaphysics, their appearance in Locke’s manuscripts and their place in the rituals of philosophers remind us that great ideas are often born from ordinary experiences. Pancakes serve as a metaphor for empiricism, tradition, and the never-ending pursuit of the “right way”—whether in breakfast or in philosophy.
