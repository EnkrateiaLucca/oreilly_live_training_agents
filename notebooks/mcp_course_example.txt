Model Context Protocol (MCP) Course

Course Overview:
This live training course covers the Model Context Protocol, a standardized way to expose tools and capabilities from external servers to AI agents. Students will learn how to build MCP servers and integrate them with LangGraph agents.

Topics Covered:
- Understanding the Model Context Protocol architecture
- Building MCP servers with FastMCP
- Creating tools using the @mcp.tool() decorator
- Connecting to multiple MCP servers with different transports
- Integrating MCP tools with LangGraph agents
- Best practices for tool design and server deployment

Example Lessons:
1. Building Your First MCP Server: Creating a simple math server with add and multiply functions
2. Advanced MCP Patterns: Working with stdio and HTTP transports
3. Multi-Server Agent Integration: Connecting weather and math servers to a single agent
4. Real-world MCP Applications: Production deployment strategies

Duration: 90 minutes
Level: Intermediate
Prerequisites: Basic Python knowledge, familiarity with LangChain/LangGraph
