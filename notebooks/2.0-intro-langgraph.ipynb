      "content='To write a simple Python script to fetch weather data, you can use a public weather API like OpenWeatherMap. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a script that fetches weather data for a specific location:\\n\\n### Step 1: Sign Up for an API Key\\n1. Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/).\\n2. Sign up for a free account.\\n3. Once registered, navigate to the API section and subscribe to the \"Current Weather Data\" API.\\n4. Obtain your API key from the dashboard.\\n\\n### Step 2: Install Required Libraries\\nYou\\'ll need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. If you haven\\'t installed it yet, you can do so using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install requests\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Write the Python Script\\nHere\\'s a simple script to fetch and display the current weather data for a specified city:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\n\\ndef get_weather_data(city_name, api_key):\\n    # Base URL for OpenWeatherMap API\\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\\n    \\n    # Parameters for the API request\\n    params = {\\n        \\'q\\': city_name,\\n        \\'appid\\': api_key,\\n        \\'units\\': \\'metric\\'  # Use \\'imperial\\' for Fahrenheit\\n    }\\n    \\n    # Make the API request\\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\\n    \\n    # Check if the request was successful\\n    if response.status_code == 200:\\n        data = response.json()\\n        # Extracting relevant data\\n        main = data[\\'main\\']\\n        weather = data[\\'weather\\'][0]\\n        \\n        # Displaying the weather information\\n        print(f\"City: {data[\\'name\\']}\")\\n        print(f\"Temperature: {main[\\'temp\\']}°C\")\\n        print(f\"Weather: {weather[\\'description\\']}\")\\n        print(f\"Humidity: {main[\\'humidity\\']}%\")\\n        print(f\"Pressure: {main[\\'pressure\\']} hPa\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\"Error fetching data. Please check the city name or API key.\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    # Replace \\'your_api_key\\' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\\n    api_key = \\'your_api_key\\'\\n    city_name = input(\"Enter city name: \")\\n    get_weather_data(city_name, api_key)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Run the Script\\n1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `weather.py`.\\n2. Run the script using Python:\\n\\n```bash\\npython weather.py\\n```\\n\\n3. Enter the city name when prompted.\\n\\n### Considerations for Scalability and Maintainability\\n- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to manage different HTTP status codes and exceptions.\\n- **Configuration Management**: Store the API key in an environment variable or a configuration file to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.\\n- **Logging**: Implement logging to track requests and responses for debugging purposes.\\n- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of the API\\'s rate limits and implement logic to handle rate limit errors gracefully.\\n- **Data Caching**: Consider caching responses to reduce the number of API calls, especially if the data doesn\\'t change frequently.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create a simple yet effective Python script to fetch and display weather data.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 685, 'prompt_tokens': 83, 'total_tokens': 768, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d8864f8b6b', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BNNENNAykNxsLaqlcuRQpGMsjRKzE', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-24d86bb1-0dd3-4110-a54f-abdf6008c361-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 83, 'output_tokens': 685, 'total_tokens': 768, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n",

Share this item with your network: By Sean Michael Kerner Ben Lutkevich, Site Editor Published: 31 Jan 2025 Large language models are the dynamite behind the generative AI boom. However, they\\'ve been around for a while. LLMs are black box AI systems that use deep learning on extremely large datasets to understand and generate new text. Modern LLMs began taking shape in 2014 when the attention mechanism -- a machine learning technique designed to mimic human cognitive attention -- was introduced in a research paper titled \"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.\" In 2017, that attention mechanism was honed with the introduction of the transformer model in another paper , \"Attention Is All You Need.\" Some of the most well-known language models today are based on the transformer model, including the generative pre-trained transformer series of LLMs and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). ChatGPT , which runs on a set of language models from OpenAI, attracted more than 100 million users just two months after its release in 2022. Since then, many competing models have been released. Some belong to big companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft; others are open source. Constant developments in the field can be difficult to keep track of. Here are some of the most influential models, both past and present. Included in it are models that paved the way for today\\'s leaders as well as those that could have a significant effect in the future. This article is part of What is GenAI? Generative AI explained Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2025 Will AI replace jobs? 17 job types that might be affected 25 of the best large language models in 2025 Top current LLMs Below are some of the most relevant large language models today.

GPT-3\\'s training data includes Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2 and Wikipedia. GPT-3 is the last of the GPT series of models in which OpenAI made the parameter counts publicly available. The GPT series was first introduced in 2018 with OpenAI\\'s paper \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\" GPT-3.5 GPT-3.5 is an upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters. GPT-3.5 was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback . GPT-3.5 is the version of GPT that powers ChatGPT. There are several models, with GPT-3.5 turbo being the most capable, according to OpenAI. GPT-3.5\\'s training data extends to September 2021. It was also integrated into the Bing search engine but has since been replaced with GPT-4. GPT-4 GPT-4 , was released in 2023 and like the others in the OpenAI GPT family, it\\'s a transformer-based model . Unlike the others, its parameter count has not been released to the public, though there are rumors that the model has more than 170 trillion. OpenAI describes GPT-4 as a multimodal model, meaning it can process and generate both language and images as opposed to being limited to only language. GPT-4 also introduced a system message, which lets users specify tone of voice and task. GPT-4 demonstrated human-level performance in multiple academic exams. At the model\\'s release, some speculated that GPT-4 came close to artificial general intelligence , which means it is as smart or smarter than a human. That speculation turned out to be unfounded. GPT-4o GPT-4 Omni ( GPT-4o ) is OpenAI\\'s successor to GPT-4 and offers several improvements over the previous model.
