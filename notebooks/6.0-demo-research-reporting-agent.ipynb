Sign up for The 74 Newsletter The future of education has never looked more creative and promising. Since making its public debut last year, ChatGPT has profoundly impacted my perspective on generative AI in education. As a writer and former high school English teacher, I experienced an existential crisis watching the chatbot effortlessly generate lesson plans and rubrics — tasks that would have taken me hours to accomplish. Generative AI allows educators to move beyond traditional learning systems and provide a more responsive, personalized learning experience in which students demonstrate mastery, not just passing grades. “The future of AI in education is not just about adopting new technologies; it’s about reshaping our approach to teaching and learning in a way that is as dynamic and diverse as the students we serve,” XQ Institute Senior Advisor Laurence Holt said. He also formerly worked in the education, business and technology sectors. Through AI, we can also transcend the limitations of the Carnegie Unit — a century-old system in which a high school diploma is based on how much time students spend in specific subject classes. Changing that rigid system is our mission at XQ . We work with schools and communities to transform high school learning so it’s more relevant and engaging while also preparing students to succeed in college, career and real life. We recently co-convened a two-day summit with the Emerson Collective, in partnership with MeshEd and Betaworks, to bring educators and innovators together in a collaborative space — envisioning ways to use AI technology for transforming high school redesign. Those ideas and insights are available to explore on this beta wiki page . After a year’s worth of conversations and observations with educators, our AI convening and EdTech Week 2023 , there is much to share with educators to help them make the most of the rapidly evolving ecosystem of artificial intelligence. Here are seven AI in education trends to be aware of next year. 1. Professional Development Throughout 2023, demand for AI professional development for educators remained high. In 2024, we should see an avalanche of districts and schools providing their educators with AI professional development materials to integrate these tools into their teaching practices. At PSI High , an XQ school in Sanford, Florida, MIT’s STEP Lab ’s Sarah Wharton visited to present interesting ways to think about AI in the context of the school. “We looked at ChatGPT as a possible tutor, personal assistant, creative tool and research assistant,” said PSI High School Coordinator Angela Daniel. “In our PD session, we considered how these cool applications could be used in classrooms as learning tools that accelerate learning and teach the tool simultaneously.” Daniel explained that teaching students how to use AI is a first step that will change things for students going forward.“But to really get at the heart of that question, we need to understand how generative AI can change our processes and resources right now,” she added. For the team at PSI, that means learning how to use generative AI effectively with ongoing support as the application continues to evolve. Workshops, online courses and collaborative learning communities are also increasingly popular for providing educators with hands-on experience in AI.

Formal AI Policy Integrating AI in classrooms is no longer a matter of “if” but “how,” making it imperative for educators and policymakers to navigate this terrain with informed and responsible strategies. However, the landscape of AI policy development — especially regarding education — has been dynamic, if not lagging. The Council of Europe has continued providing critical insights for equitable policy and practice, an area where U.S. schools have been seeking guidance . New York City Public Schools, after initially banning ChatGPT, is now collaborating with academics, experts and school districts in the AI Policy Lab , focusing on issues such as privacy and cybersecurity. Recently, the Biden administration issued an executive order to guide the U.S. in leveraging artificial intelligence. This directive emphasized AI safety, privacy, equity and responsible use, signaling a shift in how AI is integrated into sectors like education. However, it is likely that AI policy in education will develop on a location-by-location basis first. 3. Open-Source Tool Development Concerns about AI’s ethical implications and biases are sure to shape policy goals. One way to alleviate those pressures is the expansion and increased use of open-sourced tools — programs where the code is accessible and can be modified. The potential for AI to perpetuate biases is significant , however, expect the conversation to focus less on the output of AI tools and more on the kind of data it’s trained on . Ensuring AI tools are equitable and inclusive goes beyond technical challenges — it requires continuous dialogue among educators, technologists and policymakers. This conversation is essential for addressing data privacy, surveillance and ethical use of student data. With a democratized, open-source marketplace, we could see the market promote open-sourced tools as they grow in popularity. 4. Frameworks for Teaching AI Before the start of the 2023-24 academic year, educators and schools were waiting for a framework to guide their integration of AI tools . As policy moves forward in 2024 and more institutions develop professional development materials to train and support educators, expect AI curricula frameworks to finally emerge. Frameworks like TeachAI are being developed to guide the integration of AI in education. These frameworks focus on aligning AI applications with educational goals and promoting equitable access to technology, ensuring that AI complements and enhances student learning experiences. 5. AI Literacy, Competencies and Standards With AI becoming more prevalent in various sectors, including education, there’s a growing need to integrate AI literacy goals and specific learning outcomes into school curricula. This involves teaching students how to use AI tools and understand the basics of AI technology, its applications and its implications. At the Purdue Polytechnic High School network, an XQ partner with three campuses in Indiana , CEO Keeanna Warren explained how equipping staff and students with the knowledge and skills to harness AI’s potential promotes effective and responsible use of AI to enhance learning experiences. “We firmly believe that our students’ innate curiosity drives their desire to learn, and we trust their integrity,” she said. “If AI can be used for cheating, it reflects a flaw in the assessment, not in our students’ character.” The challenge lies in integrating AI literacy into an already packed curriculum. However, the opportunity to foster critical thinking, problem-solving and ethical reasoning skills through AI education is entirely possible. 6. AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Systems One of the more exciting pathways with AI is that student learning experiences will become more uniquely adaptive and personalized with a quicker turnaround. But creating effective programs requires training these systems on some level of student data -– a delicate balance. As policy formalizes how student data gets implemented into these programs, AI-driven adaptive learning systems will emerge to shift instructional practice. Expect these programs to appear prominently in assessments and curriculum packages before evolving into real-time feedback systems that can inform teachers even during a lesson. 7. Custom GPTs Built By Educators While all these advancements are promising and exciting, the marketplace for AI-driven ed tech tools will become incredibly crowded quickly. Recently, OpenAI’s maker space for building and using custom GPTs, which both use and are built by ChatGPT, is guaranteed to be a massive disruptor. Ty Boyland, school-based enterprise coordinator and music production teacher at Crosstown High, designed a custom GPT. ( Crosstown High is another XQ school in Memphis, Tennessee .) Boyland’s students use Dall-E, an AI system for generating images, with GPT-4 to create designs and prints for student-driven projects. “But how do you create a project combining culinary and music production?” Boyland wondered. His customized GPT pairs XQ’s competencies with Tennessee State Standards to build a new project. It will be interesting to see what educators create in this space to resolve pain points teachers and schools are intimately familiar with and what gets made to help schools achieve their vision and mission. The Bottom Line for Educators From policy shifts emphasizing equity and privacy to the emergence of AI-driven curricula, the transformation is palpable. We’ve seen how AI can revolutionize and disrupt classroom practices, empower educators through professional development, and create inclusive, personalized student learning experiences. But the burgeoning AI ed tech market demands discernment. Educators must navigate this space wisely , choosing tools that genuinely enhance learning and align with ethical standards. As we enter 2024, educators and stakeholders face a challenge: keeping pace with AI and engaging with it thoughtfully to catalyze educational excellence instead of just putting a new face on old practices. It’s the primary reason we at XQ convened so many educators and innovators into one space— to rethink high school by harnessing the potential of our AI-powered future.

From breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision to improved adoption of AI by businesses, we’ve seen several milestones. It's no doubt that AI will continue its explosive growth into 2023. However, given the rapid pace of change, it's important to separate meaningful advancements from distracting fads. To understand the top AI trends, I asked industry leaders and academic experts five questions. It’s the age of human-machine collaboration, so what better way to demonstrate this than by asking AI software about the 2023 AI trends it’s excited about? I did that too. I asked the same five questions below to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and included the AI model’s responses alongside that of the human experts. Additionally, the AI wrote this article's opening two paragraphs you read above. 1. What do you think was the biggest achievement in the AI space in 2022? 2. What’s the most exciting AI trend that you look forward to materializing in 2023? 3. What’s a fad in this space that you wish would go away next year? 4. To get value from AI, what’s one thing that leaders can start doing today that doesn’t take big effort or money? MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor 5. What’s one thing that leaders should stop doing immediately to realize benefits from AI? This article is organized around these questions. Feel free to skip around to those that interest you the most. Don’t miss to contrast the human responses with that of the AI for each question! Note: Check footnotes for the ChatGPT version and usage approach for this article. 1. What do you think was the biggest achievement in the AI space in 2022? Key milestones on the business application of AI in 2022 getty AI-generated content took the world by storm – apps such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney created viral content and won competitions . We saw advances in synthetic data and the use of AI in business decision-making. AI broke new ground in the pharma and healthcare domains. However, ChatGPT was stumped while answering this question since the AI model was trained with data only until 2021. We'll likely mark 2022 as the year when AI became truly accessible to the general public. Achievements in transformer architectures such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT will revolutionize many industries in the years to come. - Grace Chang , Founder and CEO of Kintsugi I'm excited by the increased focus on engineering AI around processes to improve decision-making – either automating it or dramatically improving the choices for human decision-makers. This is more of a paradigm shift than folks realize. It was previously expected that AI would show business leaders how stupid their process was and enlighten them on the need for process reengineering. We all know how well that works. - Drew Smith , vice-president of Global Data and Analytics of Little Caesars Enterprises, Inc. and Ilitch Companies AI in health, is going commercial beyond the earlier-adopting areas such as radiology and pathology. We see in our very own field of fertility that AI is no longer considered a “future” technology with great promise but rather a legitimate, evidence-based, and maturing technology that may help healthcare professionals (HCPs) provide better care and improve their business performance. 2022 was when this change of heart started in practice for AI in fertility, and 2023 will be a scale-up year. - Eran Eshed , CEO of Fairtlity I’m excited by the advancement of synthetic data allowing my data science team to feed our machine learning (ML) models with data to simulate large populations of people with diseases. Synthetic test data allows us to reflect on 'what if' scenarios, making it an ideal way to test a hypothesis. It is a more accurate, scalable, and economically feasible replacement for real-world records to generate large training datasets and reduce restrictions with the use of sensitive data. - Richie Bavasso , Co-Founder and CEO of nQ Medical Can AlphaFold be called the biggest achievement in AI for life sciences? Google DeepMind’s AI system successfully predicted proteins’ three-dimensional shapes. While this is an essential step in drug discovery, more complexities remain in understanding disease biology. If AlphaFold solved 3D structures of 220 million proteins, Meta AI claims to have predicted structures for 600 million proteins using large language models. This AI research between academia and industry has immense potential, such as finding cures for RNA viruses that cause diseases like COVID. - Subha Madhavan , vice-president, Early Clinical Development Data Sciences and AI/ML of Pfizer I'm sorry, but I am a language model trained by OpenAI and my knowledge cutoff is 2021, so I am not able to provide information about developments or achievements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) beyond that year. - OpenAI ChatGPT 2. What’s the most exciting AI trend that you look forward to materializing in 2023? Exciting AI trends to look forward to in 2023 getty Using AI to improve data quality could create a virtuous cycle for the technology to improve exponentially. 2023 could usher in the democratization of AI through governmental initiatives and the use of AI to develop new business models. On the other hand, ChatGPT is excited about AI becoming more explainable and transparent. In the past, AI automated operational decisions such as Call Center Operations. In 2023, I want to see algorithms used at the strategic level to develop new business models. Imagine a company like John Deere, which makes tractors, combines, harvesters, and other agricultural equipment. If Deere embeds sensors in their equipment and collects product-in-use data, they can construct data graphs and use AI to analyze them to create new pockets of value. Deere can transform from an equipment manufacturer to an insight provider and solve customer problems. Deere’s vision should be to become the leader in precision agriculture, where their own products will be part of the solution, not the whole solution. Deere’s identity can change from Made by Us to Solved by Us. AI can drive this transformation journey for all industrial companies, including Deere, GM, and Rolls Royce. - Vijay Govindarajan , Coxe Distinguished Professor of Management at The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth The deployment of AI against data itself – as in addressing data quality, assessing data vulnerability, and data duplication. You see this in the integration of AI further up the data pipeline, like in master data management, data governance, and extract-transform-load (ETL) processes. And the potential increase in the speed of insights is huge. - Drew Smith Government-led initiatives like the National AI Research Resource Task Force (NAIRR) launched by the Biden Administration will spark national discussions on AI. This can help democratize access and accelerate meaningful changes in industries like healthcare. A small Berkeley startup like ours is commercializing voice biomarker research, funded by the National Science Foundation, to address the $200 Bn cost of undiagnosed depression. - Grace Chang In 2023, we will see teams leveraging AI to integrate data across disciplines. Integrating multimodal data from advanced molecular, radiological, and pathological imaging and patient-specific clinical data will enable the prediction of drug targets, disease outcomes, and individualized patient responses. For example, long COVID has pushed over 4 million US workers out of the labor force with a five-year lost wage cost of $1 trillion. AI leveraging multi-modal data, including images, text, structured data, and voice, can help develop treatment and patient management strategies to address long COVID in 2023. - Subha Madhavan I think 2023 will be the year of AI deployment and adoption for precision medicine. You can have the best algorithms in the world that detect a disease early, but for it to be effective, we must deploy them in healthcare practices and help clinical teams adopt them. Today, we are seeing integrated delivery networks (IDNs) improving their technological infrastructure to deploy AI algorithms for the earlier detection of diseases across areas such as oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. - Najat Khan , Chief Data Science Officer and Global Head of Strategy and Operations for Research and Development of Janssen Explainability and transparency: There is growing interest in ensuring that AI systems are transparent and explainable, particularly when they are being used in decision-making processes that affect people's lives. This could lead to the development of new techniques and technologies for explaining the decisions made by AI systems, as well as the creation of more transparent and interpretable models. - OpenAI ChatGPT 3. What’s a fad in this space that you wish would go away next year? The biggest fads that we hope will wither away getty We are still struggling to define AI, and on the other hand, most industry surveys on the adoption of AI aren’t actionable. Strangely, ChatGPT considers AI to be overhyped, while human experts are tired of doomsday predictions about AI making humans redundant. Most of what people refer to as AI is, in fact, not AI – it is machine learning (ML). I realize AI is sexier than ML, however, there is a significant difference. ML is based on the idea that machines are enabled to learn and adapt through experience (sic data). AI refers to a broader idea, and it applies ML, deep learning, and other techniques to solve actual problems. An “intelligent” computer uses AI to think like a human and perform tasks on its own. ML is how a computer system develops its intelligence. AI, by its true definition, does not yet exist. - Richie Bavasso The idea that AI is a replacement for humans is a fad. The release of chatGPT revived talk again about AI making humans either lazy or obsolete. Every new technological advance has been met with these doomsday predictions. Machines are wonderful at solving problems that have clear parameters and historical precedents. Humans are really great at understanding nuance, context, and conceptual problem-solving. Studies have shown that the collaboration between AI and humans results in better medical outcomes. - Ngan Khanh Nguyen MacDonald , Chief of Data Operations, Institute for Augmented Intelligence in Medicine at Northwestern University Citing senseless and unmovable statistics about AI must go - \"94% of leaders say AI is essential to their success\". Really? And how many can describe what it is and how specifically it will enable their success? Very few, which is why \"50% of analytic professionals cite lack of executive support\" as the reason for AI not delivering. And there are several industry surveys whose figures have not changed in the last 5 years. - Drew Smith Hype and overhyping of AI: The field of AI has received a lot of attention in recent years, and this has sometimes led to hype and overhyping of the capabilities and potential of AI technologies. While AI can be a powerful tool, it is important to be realistic about what it can and cannot do, and to be aware of the limitations and potential risks associated with its use. - OpenAI ChatGPT 4. To get value from AI, what’s one thing that leaders can start doing today that doesn’t take big effort or money Simple resets that will help deliver business value from AI getty Who doesn’t love simple hacks that can be done today with little effort? Experts opine that organizations will benefit by defining the real business purpose of AI. They can save time by doubling down on data quality before spending boatloads of money on models. ChatGPT recommends leaders educate themselves on AI and its risks to make informed decisions about deploying it. Start brainstorming about the particular business use cases in your organization that can benefit from massive amounts of data to assist in day-to-day tasks. Remember, AI is good at recognizing patterns, and humans are good at understanding when those patterns have meaning versus when they are spurious correlations. - Ngan Khanh Nguyen MacDonald Often, many leaders hire the team first and then try to figure out what they'll do. That just doesn't work. While developing our strategy at Janssen, we think about the questions to pursue and prioritize them based on two factors - business importance and data science feasibility. Focusing on the prioritized list of initiatives helps deliver impact, secure buy-in, and build the organizational momentum to do more. That’s what I did at J&J two years ago as a new emerging leader. By reviewing our program pipeline, I picked the priority areas to apply data science. For some programs, it was accelerating trial recruitment, whereas in others, it was finding more precise endpoints to measure patient outcomes better. This helped us figure out the top ten programs to go after. - Najat Khan Dive deeper into your existing data. Focusing on data initiatives such as data sampling, data augmentation, and training procedures can lead to outsized gains in AI performance. It does not require acquiring more data or investigating a new model architecture. - Alex Lang , vice-president of Technology of Unlearn Leaders need to align and educate – the only cost in doing so is time. One of the main obstacles to mass AI adoption in healthcare is building trust and educating on what AI can and cannot do. AI should be marketed responsibly or risk being perceived as immature or overhyped. We are tackling this challenge head-on through a society that aims to provide professional leadership in the provisioning and regulation of AI in fertility. - Eran Eshed Educating themselves about AI: One of the most important things that leaders can do is to educate themselves about the capabilities and limitations of AI, as well as the potential benefits and risks associated with its use. This can help leaders to better understand how AI can be used to support their organizations and to make informed decisions about its adoption and deployment. - OpenAI ChatGPT 5. What’s one thing that leaders should stop doing immediately to realize benefits from AI? Destructive habits that leaders must give up on to realize value from AI getty It’s time companies stopped AI washing , the marketing gimmick of labeling products with AI just to make them sell. Leaders ignoring data quality or tolerating an AI “black box” approach put their businesses at risk. When organizations push data privacy onto the back burner, it will come back to bite them. Business leaders interject AI into descriptions of their products and services as if, without it, the offering could not exist. It is time to address whether the addition of AI actually adds value to problem resolution. In many cases, it does not. There is often not enough data to feed AI models, infrastructure to support consumption, or mechanisms to make the data actionable. - Richie Bavasso Stop treating AI as a “black box” and start taking a “glass box” approach. Transparency is the key to gaining trust from all stakeholders. Trust is built through explainability, which we all know is challenging to achieve with AI. In the healthcare space, in particular, leaders should stop taking the easy/perceived-short route to AI adoption and start exposing the biology behind the AI analysis. - Eran Eshed Stop encouraging AI scientists to be preoccupied with whether they could train a model on a dataset, and instead have them stop to think if they should. Stability AI released Stable Diffusion V1, a groundbreaking text-to-image model, without thoroughly diving into their data and thinking if they should train a model on copyrighted and not-safe-for-work (NSFW) data. Instead, they waited for V2 to correct this shortcoming, but at this point, they have already broken trust and exposed themselves to litigation risk . - Alex Lang Underestimating the importance of data quality: AI systems rely on data to learn and make decisions, so it is important to ensure that the data used to train and evaluate these systems is of high quality. Leaders should avoid using poor quality data or ignoring issues with data quality, as this can lead to flawed or biased AI systems that do not deliver the desired results. - OpenAI ChatGPT So, what’s in store for 2024? AI has transitioned from being just interesting to delivering impact for businesses and consumers. 2023 will see AI adoption skyrocket by the rapid diffusion of models into all kinds of applications. Standardized software and devices that organizations use daily will become smarter with the infusion of AI, while new-age apps will mushroom and continue to blur the boundaries between reality and science fiction. We live in interesting times where AI can now make predictions about upcoming AI trends. While ChatGPT is ages ahead of any chatbot we’ve seen so far, there was the unmistakable human curation involved in picking a subset of the text from AI’s answers for this article. Nevertheless, this AI model gives a sneak preview of the powerful AI capabilities that are in store for us in 2023. While I don’t expect AI to autonomously write the 2024 AI trends around this time next year, the extent of human supervision that will be needed is anyone’s guess. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

By Melissa Heikkilä archive page December 19, 2023 Stephanie Arnett/MITTR | Midjourney This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here . This has been one of the craziest years in AI in a long time: endless product launches, boardroom coups, intense policy debates about AI doom, and a race to find the next big thing. But we’ve also seen concrete tools and policies aimed at getting the AI sector to behave more responsibly and hold powerful players accountable. That gives me a lot of hope for the future of AI. Here’s what 2023 taught me: 1. Generative AI left the lab with a vengeance, but it’s not clear where it will go next The year started with Big Tech going all in on generative AI. The runaway success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT prompted every major tech company to release its own version. This year might go down in history as the year we saw the most AI launches: Meta’s LLaMA 2 , Google’s Bard chatbot and Gemini , Baidu’s Ernie Bot , OpenAI’s GPT-4 , and a handful of other models, including one from a French open-source challenger, Mistral. But despite the initial hype, we haven’t seen any AI applications become an overnight success. Microsoft and Google pitched powerful AI-powered search , but it turned out to be more of a dud than a killer app. The fundamental flaws in language models, such as the fact that they frequently make stuff up , led to some embarrassing (and, let’s be honest, hilarious) gaffes. Microsoft’s Bing would frequently reply to people’s questions with conspiracy theories , and suggested that a New York Times reporter leave his wife. Google’s Bard generated factually incorrect answers for its marketing campaign, which wiped $100 billion off the company’s share price. There is now a frenetic hunt for a popular AI product that everyone will want to adopt. Both OpenAI and Google are experimenting with allowing companies and developers to create customized AI chatbots and letting people build their own applications using AI—no coding skills needed. Perhaps generative AI will end up embedded in boring but useful tools to help us boost our productivity at work . It might take the form of AI assistants —maybe with voice capabilities —and coding support . Next year will be crucial in determining the real value of generative AI. 2. We learned a lot about how language models actually work, but we still know very little Even though tech companies are rolling out large language models into products at a frenetic pace, there is still a lot we don’t know about how they work . They make stuff up and have severe gender and ethnic biases. This year we also found out that different language models generate texts with different political biases , and that they make great tools for hacking people’s private information. Text-to-image models can be prompted to spit out copyrighted images and pictures of real people , and they can easily be tricked into generating disturbing images . It’s been great to see so much research into the flaws of these models, because this could take us a step closer to understanding why they behave the way they do, and ultimately fix them. Generative models can be very unpredictable, and this year there were lots of attempts to try to make them behave as their creators want them to. OpenAI shared that it uses a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback , which uses feedback from users to help guide ChatGPT to more desirable answers. A study from the AI lab Anthropic showed how simple natural-language instructions can steer large language models to make their results less toxic. But sadly, a lot of these attempts end up being quick fixes rather than permanent ones. Then there are misguided approaches like banning seemingly innocuous words such as “ placenta ” from image-generating AI systems to avoid producing gore. Tech companies come up with workarounds like these because they don’t know why models generate the content they do. We also got a better sense of AI’s true carbon footprint. Generating an image using a powerful AI model takes as much energy as fully charging your smartphone , researchers at the AI startup Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University found. Until now, the exact amount of energy generative AI uses has been a missing piece of the puzzle. More research into this could help us shift the way we use AI to be more sustainable. 3. AI doomerism went mainstream Chatter about the possibility that AI poses an existential risk to humans became familiar this year. Hundreds of scientists, business leaders, and policymakers have spoken up, from deep-learning pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio to the CEOs of top AI firms, such as Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis, to the California congressman Ted Lieu and the former president of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid. Existential risk has become one of the biggest memes in AI . The hypothesis is that one day we will build an AI that is far smarter than humans , and this could lead to grave consequences. It’s an ideology championed by many in Silicon Valley, including Ilya Sutskever , OpenAI’s chief scientist, who played a pivotal role in ousting OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (and then reinstating him a few days later). But not everyone agrees with this idea. Meta’s AI leaders Yann LeCun and Joelle Pineau have said that these fears are “ridiculous” and the conversation about AI risks has become “unhinged.” Many other power players in AI, such as researcher Joy Buolamwini , say that focusing on hypothetical risks distracts from the very real harms AI is causing today. Nevertheless, the increased attention on the technology’s potential to cause extreme harm has prompted many important conversations about AI policy and animated lawmakers all over the world to take action. 4. The days of the AI Wild West are over Thanks to ChatGPT, everyone from the US Senate to the G7 was talking about AI policy and regulation this year. In early December, European lawmakers wrapped up a busy policy year when they agreed on the AI Act , which will introduce binding rules and standards on how to develop the riskiest AI more responsibly. It will also ban certain “unacceptable” applications of AI, such as police use of facial recognition in public places. The White House, meanwhile, introduced an executive order on AI , plus voluntary commitments from leading AI companies. Its efforts aimed to bring more transparency and standards for AI and gave a lot of freedom to agencies to adapt AI rules to fit their sectors. One concrete policy proposal that got a lot of attention was watermarks—invisible signals in text and images that can be detected by computers, in order to flag AI-generated content. These could be used to track plagiarism or help fight disinformation, and this year we saw research that succeeded in applying them to AI-generated text and images . It wasn’t just lawmakers that were busy, but lawyers too. We saw a record number of  lawsuits , as artists and writers argued that AI companies had scraped their intellectual property without their consent and with no compensation. In an exciting counter-offensive, researchers at the University of Chicago developed Nightshade , a new data-poisoning tool that lets artists fight back against generative AI by messing up training data in ways that could cause serious damage to image-generating AI models. There is a resistance brewing, and I expect more grassroots efforts to shift tech’s power balance next year. Deeper Learning Now we know what OpenAI’s superalignment team has been up to OpenAI has announced the first results from its superalignment team, its in-house initiative dedicated to preventing a superintelligence—a hypothetical future AI that can outsmart humans—from going rogue. The team is led by chief scientist Ilya Sutskever , who was part of the group that just last month fired OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, only to reinstate him a few days later. Business as usual: Unlike many of the company’s announcements, this heralds no big breakthrough. In a low-key research paper, the team describes a technique that lets a less powerful large language model supervise a more powerful one—and suggests that this might be a small step toward figuring out how humans might supervise superhuman machines.

Bits and Bytes Google DeepMind used a large language model to solve an unsolvable math problem In a paper published in Nature, the company says it is the first time a large language model has been used to discover a solution to a long-standing scientific puzzle—producing verifiable and valuable new information that did not previously exist. ( MIT Technology Review ) This new system can teach a robot a simple household task within 20 minutes A new open-source system, called Dobb-E, was trained using data collected from real homes. It can help to teach a robot how to open an air fryer, close a door, or straighten a cushion, among other tasks. It could also help the field of robotics overcome one of its biggest challenges: a lack of training data.  ( MIT Technology Review ) ChatGPT is turning the internet into plumbing German media giant Axel Springer, which owns Politico and Business Insider, announced a partnership with OpenAI, in which the tech company will be able to use its news articles as training data and the news organizations will be able to use ChatGPT to do summaries of news. This column has a clever point: tech companies are increasingly becoming gatekeepers for online content, and journalism is just “plumbing for a digital faucet.” ( The Atlantic ) Meet the former French official pushing for looser AI rules after joining startup Mistral A profile of Mistral AI cofounder Cédric O, who used to be France’s digital minister. Before joining France’s AI unicorn, he was a vocal proponent of strict laws for tech, but he lobbied hard against rules in the AI Act that would have restricted Mistral’s models. He was successful: the company’s models don’t meet the computing threshold set by the law, and its open-source models are also exempt from transparency obligations.

You have reached a page with older survey data. Please see our 2024 survey results here . (24 pages) The latest annual McKinsey Global Survey Â on the current state of AI confirms the explosive growth of generative AI (gen AI) tools . Less than a year after many of these tools debuted, one-third of our survey respondents say their organizations are using gen AI regularly in at least one business function. Amid recent advances, AI has risen from a topic relegated to tech employees to a focus of company leaders: nearly one-quarter of surveyed C-suite executives say they are personally using\n",
      "gen AI tools for work, and more than one-quarter of respondents from companies using AI say gen AI is already on their boardsâ agendas. Whatâs more, 40 percent of respondents say their organizations will increase their investment in AI overall because of advances in gen AI. The findings show that these are still early days for managing gen AIârelated risks, with less than half of respondents saying their organizations are mitigating even the risk they consider most relevant: inaccuracy. The organizations that have already embedded AI capabilities have been the first to explore gen AIâs potential, and those seeing the most value from more traditional AI capabilitiesâa group we call AI high performersâare already outpacing others in their adoption of gen AI tools. 1 We define AI high performers as organizations that, according to respondents, attribute at least 20 percent of their EBIT to AI adoption. The expected business disruption from gen AI is significant, and respondents predict meaningful changes to their workforces. They anticipate workforce cuts in certain areas and large reskilling efforts to address shifting talent needs. Yet while the use of gen AI might spur the adoption of other AI tools, we see few meaningful increases in organizationsâ adoption of these technologies. The percent of organizations adopting any AI tools has held steady since 2022, and adoption remains concentrated within a small number of business functions. Table of Contents Itâs early days still, but use of gen AI is already widespread Leading companies are already ahead with gen AI AI-related talent needs shift, and AIâs workforce effects are expected to be substantial With all eyes on gen AI, AI adoption and impact remain steady About the research Â 1. Itâs early days still, but use of gen AI is already widespread The findings from the surveyâwhich was in the field in mid-April 2023âshow that, despite gen AIâs nascent public availability, experimentation with the tools Â is already relatively common, and respondents expect the new capabilities to transform their industries. Gen AI has captured interest across the business population: individuals across regions, industries, and seniority levels are using gen AI for work and outside of work. Seventy-nine percent of all respondents say theyâve had at least some exposure to gen AI, either for work or outside of work, and 22Â percent say they are regularly using it in their own work. While reported use is quite similar across seniority levels, it is highest among respondents working in the technology sector and those in North America. Interactive Organizations, too, are now commonly using gen AI. One-third of all respondents say their organizations are already regularly using generative AI in at least one functionâmeaning that 60Â percent of organizations with reported AI adoption are using gen AI. Whatâs more, 40 percent of those reporting AI adoption at their organizations say their companies expect to invest more in AI overall thanks to generative AI, and 28 percent say generative AI use is already on their boardâs agenda. The most commonly reported business functions using these newer tools are the same as those in which AI use is most common overall: marketing and sales, product and service development, and service operations, such as customer care and back-office support. This suggests that organizations are pursuing these new tools where the most value is. In our previous research , these three areas, along with software engineering, showed the potential to deliver about 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases. In these early days, expectations for gen AIâs impact are high : three-quarters of all respondents expect gen AI to cause significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industryâs competition in the next three years. Survey respondents working in the technology and financial-services industries are the most likely to expect disruptive change from gen AI. Our previous research shows Â that, while all industries are indeed likely to see some degree of disruption, the level of impact is likely to vary. 2 â The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier ,â McKinsey, June 14, 2023. Industries relying most heavily on knowledge work are likely to see more disruptionâand potentially reap more value. While our estimates suggest that tech companies, unsurprisingly, are poised to see the highest impact from gen AIâadding value equivalent to as much as 9 percent of global industry revenueâknowledge-based industries such as banking (up to 5 percent), pharmaceuticals and medical products (also up to 5 percent), and education (up to 4 percent) could experience significant effects as well. By contrast, manufacturing-based industries, such as aerospace, automotives, and advanced electronics, could experience less disruptive effects. This stands in contrast to the impact of previous technology waves that affected manufacturing the most and is due to gen AIâs strengths in language-based activities, as opposed to those requiring physical labor. Responses show many organizations not yet addressing potential risks from gen AI According to the survey, few companies seem fully prepared for the widespread use of gen AIâor the business risks these tools may bring. Just 21 percent of respondents reporting AI adoption say their organizations have established policies governing employeesâ use of gen AI technologies in their work. And when we asked specifically about the risks of adopting gen AI, few respondents say their companies are mitigating the most commonly cited risk with gen AI: inaccuracy. Respondents cite inaccuracy more frequently than both cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, which were the most common risks from AI overall in previous surveys. Just 32 percent say theyâre mitigating inaccuracy, a smaller percentage than the 38Â percent who say they mitigate cybersecurity risks. Interestingly, this figure is significantly lower than the percentage of respondents who reported mitigating AI-related cybersecurity last year (51 percent). Overall, much as weâve seen in previous years, most respondents say their organizations are not addressing AI-related risks. Â 2. Leading companies are already ahead with gen AI The survey results show that AI high performersâthat is, organizations where respondents say at least 20 percent of EBIT in 2022 was attributable to AI useâare going all in on artificial intelligence, both with gen AI and more traditional AI capabilities. These organizations that achieve significant value from AI are already using gen AI in more business functions than other organizations do, especially in product and service development and risk and supply chain management. When looking at all AI capabilitiesâincluding more traditional machine learning capabilities, robotic process automation, and chatbotsâAI high performers also are much more likely than others to use AI in product and service development, for uses such as product-development-cycle optimization, adding new features to existing products, and creating new AI-based products. These organizations also are using AI more often than other organizations in risk modeling and for uses within HR such as performance management and organization design and workforce deployment optimization. AI high performers are much more likely than others to use AI in product and service development. Another difference from their peers: high performersâ gen AI efforts are less oriented toward cost reduction, which is a top priority at other organizations. Respondents from AI high performers are twice as likely as others to say their organizationsâ top objective for gen AI is to create entirely new businesses or sources of revenueâand theyâre most likely to cite the increase in the value of existing offerings through new AI-based features. As weâve seen in previous years , these high-performing organizations invest much more than others in AI: respondents from AI high performers are more than five times more likely than others to say they spend more than 20 percent of their digital budgets on AI. They also use AI capabilities more broadly throughout the organization. Respondents from high performers are much more likely than others to say that their organizations have adopted AI in four or more business functions and that they have embedded a higher number of AI capabilities. For example, respondents from high performers more often report embedding knowledge graphs in at least one product or business function process, in addition to gen AI and related natural-language capabilities. While AI high performers are not immune to the challenges of capturing value from AI, the results suggest that the difficulties they face reflect their relative AI maturity, while others struggle with the more foundational, strategic elements of AI adoption. Respondents at AI high performers most often point to models and tools, such as monitoring model performance in production and retraining models as needed over time, as their top challenge. By comparison, other respondents cite strategy issues, such as setting a clearly defined AI vision that is linked with business value or finding sufficient resources. The findings offer further evidence that even high performers havenât mastered best practices regarding AI adoption, such as machine-learning-operations (MLOps) approaches, though they are much more likely than others to do so. For example, just 35 percent of respondents at AI high performers report that where possible, their organizations assemble existing components, rather than reinvent them, but thatâs a much larger share than the 19 percent of respondents from other organizations who report that practice. Many specialized MLOps technologies and practices Â may be needed to adopt some of the more transformative uses cases that gen AI applications can deliverâand do so as safely as possible. Live-model operations is one such area, where monitoring systems and setting up instant alerts to enable rapid issue resolution can keep gen AI systems in check. High performers stand out in this respect but have room to grow: one-quarter of respondents from these organizations say their entire system is monitored and equipped with instant alerts, compared with just 12 percent of other respondents. Â 3. AI-related talent needs shift, and AIâs workforce effects are expected to be substantial Our latest survey results show changes in the roles that organizations are filling to support their AI ambitions. In the past year, organizations using AI most often hired data engineers, machine learning engineers, and Al data scientistsâall roles that respondents commonly reported hiring in the previous survey. But a much smaller share of respondents report hiring AI-related-software engineersâthe most-hired role last yearâthan in the previous survey (28 percent in the latest survey, down from 39 percent). Roles in prompt engineering have recently emerged, as the need for that skill set rises alongside gen AI adoption, with 7 percent of respondents whose organizations have adopted AI reporting those hires in the past year. The findings suggest that hiring for AI-related roles remains a challenge but has become somewhat easier over the past year, which could reflect the spate of layoffs at technology companies from late 2022 through the first half of 2023. Smaller shares of respondents than in the previous survey report difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientists, data engineers, and data-visualization specialists, though responses suggest that hiring machine learning engineers and AI product owners remains as much of a challenge as in the previous year. Looking ahead to the next three years, respondents predict that the adoption of AI will reshape many roles in the workforce. Generally, they expect more employees to be reskilled than to be separated. Nearly four in ten respondents reporting AI adoption expect more than 20 percent of their companiesâ workforces will be reskilled, whereas 8 percent of respondents say the size of their workforces will decrease by more than 20 percent. Looking specifically at gen AIâs predicted impact, service operations is the only function in which most respondents expect to see a decrease in workforce size at their organizations. This finding generally aligns with what our recent research Â suggests: while the emergence of gen AI increased our estimate of the percentage of worker activities that could be automated (60 to 70Â percent, up from 50 percent), this doesnât necessarily translate into the automation of an entire role. AI high performers are expected to conduct much higher levels of reskilling than other companies are. Respondents at these organizations are over three times more likely than others to say their organizations will reskill more than 30 percent of their workforces over the next three years as a result of AI adoption. Â 4. With all eyes on gen AI, AI adoption and impact remain steady While the use of gen AI tools is spreading rapidly, the survey data doesnât show that these newer tools are propelling organizationsâ overall AI adoption. The share of organizations that have adopted AI overall remains steady, at least for the moment, with 55 percent of respondents reporting that their organizations have adopted AI. Less than a third of respondents continue to say that their organizations have adopted AI in more than one business function, suggesting that AI use remains limited in scope. Product and service development and service operations continue to be the two business functions in which respondents most often report AI adoption, as was true in the previous four surveys. And overall, just 23 percent of respondents say at least 5 percent of their organizationsâ EBIT last year was attributable to their use of AIâessentially flat with the previous surveyâsuggesting there is much more room to capture value. Organizations continue to see returns in the business areas in which they are using AI, and\n",
      "they plan to increase investment in the years ahead. We see a majority of respondents reporting AI-related revenue increases within each business function using AI. And looking ahead, more than two-thirds expect their organizations to increase their AI investment over the next three years. Â About the research The online survey was in the field April 11 to 21, 2023, and garnered responses from 1,684 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 913 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function and were asked questions about their organizationsâ AI use. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondentâs nation to global GDP. The survey content and analysis were developed by Michael Chui , a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute and a partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, where Lareina Yee is a senior partner; Bryce Hall , an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office; and senior partners Alex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky , global leaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, based in the Chicago and London offices, respectively.

Major AI Trends in 2023 By Mathieu on October 11, 2023 - 6 min read Providing new sets of opportunities and challenges, artificial intelligence [AI] continues to be at the forefront of the world’s ongoing digital transformation, with absolutely no signs of slowing down. Major trends of Artificial Intelligence AI-powered technologies are nothing new. In fact, AI has had a transformative impact on a wide range of business sectors for at least a decade. In 2023, what is new, is the explosive growth of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard, essentially thrusting the AI sector into mainstream awareness. The numbers are simply impressive. The estimated cost of the global AI market currently stands at over $200 billion. According to a report by Precedence Research, by 2030, the volume of the global AI sector is projected to reach a staggering $1.85 trillion. In this article, Bocasay, our offshore IT agency based in Vietnam, provides an overview of the latest and most impactful AI trends in 2023. Read on! Top AI Trends in 2023 Generative AI Generative AI refers to a class of AI systems that can generate content such as text, images and audio, often in a human-like manner. These systems are designed to learn patterns and structures from large datasets, and to use that knowledge in order to create original content. While generative AI offers many benefits, it also raises ethical and legal concerns, such as the potential for the creation of fake content or misuse in malicious applications. Businesses should use generative AI responsibly and consider the ethical implications in their deployment. Here are the business sectors mostly affected by the advent of generative AI: ➤ Content Generation: Reducing the need for manual content creation, generative AI is valuable for companies that need to generate large volumes of content for marketing and social media. ➤ Product Design and Prototyping: In industries like fashion, automotive and industrial design, generative AI can assist in the generation of new product designs and prototypes. ➤ Data Augmentation: In data-related tasks, generative AI can generate synthetic data to augment existing datasets.

Feature 10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024 Custom enterprise models, open source AI, multimodal -- learn about the top AI and machine learning trends for 2024 and how they promise to transform the industry. Share this item with your network: By Lev Craig, Site Editor Published: 04 Jan 2024 After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, 2023 marked a turning point in artificial intelligence . The past year's developments, from a vibrant open source landscape to sophisticated multimodal models, have laid the groundwork for significant advances in AI . But although generative AI continues to captivate the tech world, attitudes are becoming more nuanced and mature as organizations shift their focus from experimentation to real-world initiatives. This year's trends reflect a deepening sophistication and caution in AI development and deployment strategies , with an eye to ethics, safety and the evolving regulatory landscape. Here are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024. 1. Multimodal AI Multimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information. \"The interfaces of the world are multimodal,\" said Mark Chen, head of frontiers research at OpenAI, in a November 2023 presentation at the conference EmTech MIT. \"We want our models to see what we see and hear what we hear, and we want them to also generate content that appeals to more than one of our senses.\" This article is part of A guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise Which also includes: 10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024 10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024 The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years The multimodal capabilities in OpenAI's GPT-4 model enable the software to respond to visual and audio input. In his talk, Chen gave the example of taking photos of the inside of a fridge and asking ChatGPT to suggest a recipe based on the ingredients in the photo. The interaction could even encompass an audio element if using ChatGPT's voice mode to pose the request aloud. OpenAI head of frontiers research Mark Chen addresses the audience at EmTech MIT. Although most generative AI initiatives today are text-based, \"the real power of these capabilities is going to be when you can marry up text and conversation with images and video, cross-pollinate all three of those, and apply those to a variety of businesses,\" said Matt Barrington, Americas emerging technologies leader at EY. Multimodal AI's real-world applications are diverse and expanding. In healthcare, for example, multimodal models can analyze medical images in light of patient history and genetic information to improve diagnostic accuracy. At the job function level, multimodal models can expand what various employees can do by extending basic design and coding capabilities to individuals without a formal background in those areas. \"I can't draw to save my life,\" Barrington said. \"Well, now I can. I'm decent with language, so ... I can plug into a capability like [image generation], and some of those ideas that were in my head that I could never physically draw, I can have AI do.\" Moreover, introducing multimodal capabilities could strengthen models by offering them new data to learn from. \"As our models get better and better at modeling language and start to hit the limits of what they can learn from language, we want to provide the models with raw inputs from the world so that they can perceive the world on their own and draw their own inferences from things like video or audio data,\" Chen said. 2. Agentic AI Agentic AI marks a significant shift from reactive to proactive AI. AI agents are advanced systems that exhibit autonomy, proactivity and the ability to act independently. Unlike traditional AI systems, which mainly respond to user inputs and follow predetermined programming, AI agents are designed to understand their environment, set goals and act to achieve those objectives without direct human intervention. For example, in environmental monitoring , an AI agent could be trained to collect data, analyze patterns and initiate preventive actions in response to hazards such as early signs of a forest fire. Likewise, a financial AI agent could actively manage an investment portfolio using adaptive strategies that react to changing market conditions in real time. \"2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI,\" wrote computer scientist Peter Norvig, a fellow at Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, in a recent blog post . \"In 2024, we'll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.\" In addition, combining agentic and multimodal AI could open up new possibilities. In the aforementioned presentation, Chen gave the example of an application designed to identify the contents of an uploaded image. Previously, someone looking to build such an application would have needed to train their own image recognition model and then figure out how to deploy it. But with multimodal, agentic models, this could all be accomplished through natural language prompting. \"I really think that multimodal together with GPTs will open up the no-code development of computer vision applications, just in the same way that prompting opened up the no-code development of a lot of text-based applications,\" Chen said. 3. Open source AI Building large language models and other powerful generative AI systems is an expensive process that requires enormous amounts of compute and data. But using an open source model enables developers to build on top of others' work, reducing costs and expanding AI access. Open source AI is publicly available, typically for free, enabling organizations and researchers to contribute to and build on existing code. GitHub data from the past year shows a remarkable increase in developer engagement with AI, particularly generative AI. In 2023, generative AI projects entered the top 10 most popular projects across the code hosting platform for the first time, with projects such as Stable Diffusion and AutoGPT pulling in thousands of first-time contributors. Early in the year, open source generative models were limited in number, and their performance often lagged behind proprietary options such as ChatGPT. But the landscape broadened significantly over the course of 2023 to include powerful open source contenders such as Meta's Llama 2 and Mistral AI's Mixtral models. This could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape in 2024 by providing smaller, less resourced entities with access to sophisticated AI models and tools that were previously out of reach. \"It gives everyone easy, fairly democratized access, and it's great for experimentation and exploration,\" Barrington said. Open source approaches can also encourage transparency and ethical development, as more eyes on the code means a greater likelihood of identifying biases, bugs and security vulnerabilities. But experts have also expressed concerns about the misuse of open source AI to create disinformation and other harmful content . In addition, building and maintaining open source is difficult even for traditional software, let alone complex and compute-intensive AI models. 4. Retrieval-augmented generation Although generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of hallucinations : plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption. RAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs. \"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said. These benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with foundation models to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants. 5. Customized enterprise generative AI models Massive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements. While creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build customized generative AI , most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM. \"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\" The key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, such as healthcare , finance and legal. In many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said. Barrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said. On a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS. Building a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\" In light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte. \"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said. 6. Need for AI and machine learning talent Designing, training and testing a machine learning model is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It's no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is expected to continue into 2024 and beyond . \"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It's very easy to get a job in this space.\" In particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there's a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as MLOps , short for machine learning operations. In a recent O'Reilly report , respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said. In 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation. Crossan also emphasized the importance of diversity in AI initiatives at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\" 7. Shadow AI As employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the issue of shadow AI : use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently. Shadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes. On the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties. \"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\" Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT. In 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear acceptable AI use policies and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI. \"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY research finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\" 8. A generative AI reality check As organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the Gartner Hype Cycle . \"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said. As early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated. \"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production in a real product setting,\" Luke said. The silver lining is that these growing pains, while unpleasant in the short term, could result in a healthier, more tempered outlook in the long run. Moving past this phase will require setting realistic expectations for AI and developing a more nuanced understanding of what AI can and can't do. AI projects should be clearly tied to business goals and practical use cases, with a clear plan in place for measuring outcomes . \"If you have very loose use cases that are not clearly defined, that's probably what's going to hold you up the most,\" Crossan said. 9. Increased attention to AI ethics and security risks The proliferation of deepfakes and sophisticated AI-generated content is raising alarms about the potential for misinformation and manipulation in media and politics, as well as identity theft and other types of fraud. AI can also enhance the efficacy of ransomware and phishing attacks, making them more convincing, more adaptable and harder to detect. Although efforts are underway to develop technologies for detecting AI-generated content , doing so remains challenging. Current AI watermarking techniques are relatively easy to circumvent, and existing AI detection software can be prone to false positives. The increasing ubiquity of AI systems also highlights the importance of ensuring that they are transparent and fair -- for example, by carefully vetting training data and algorithms for bias. Crossan emphasized that these ethics and compliance considerations should be interwoven throughout the process of developing an AI strategy. \"You have to be thinking about, as an enterprise ... implementing AI, what are the controls that you're going to need?\" she said. \"And that starts to help you plan a bit for the regulation so that you're doing it together. You're not doing all of this experimentation with AI and then [realizing], 'Oh, now we need to think about the controls.' You do it at the same time.\" Safety and ethics can also be another reason to look at smaller, more narrowly tailored models, Luke pointed out. \"These smaller, tuned, domain-specific models are just far less capable than the really big ones -- and we want that,\" he said. \"They're less likely to be able to output something that you don't want because they're just not capable of as many things.\" 10. Evolving AI regulation Unsurprisingly, given these ethics and security concerns, 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for AI regulation , with laws, policies and industry frameworks rapidly evolving in the U.S. and globally. Organizations will need to stay informed and adaptable in the coming year, as shifting compliance requirements could have significant implications for global operations and AI development strategies. The EU's AI Act, on which members of the EU's Parliament and Council recently reached a provisional agreement , represents the world's first comprehensive AI law. If adopted, it would ban certain uses of AI, impose obligations for developers of high-risk AI systems and require transparency from companies using generative AI, with noncompliance potentially resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. And it's not just new legislation that could have an effect in 2024. \"Interestingly enough, the regulatory issue that I see could have the biggest impact is GDPR -- good old-fashioned GDPR -- because of the need for rectification and erasure, the right to be forgotten, with public large language models,\" Crossan said. \"How do you control that when they're learning from massive amounts of data, and how can you assure that you've been forgotten?\" Together with the GDPR, the AI Act could position the EU as a global AI regulator, potentially influencing AI use and development standards worldwide. \"They're certainly ahead of where we are in the U.S. from an AI regulatory perspective,\" Crossan said. The U.S. doesn't yet have comprehensive federal legislation comparable to the EU's AI Act, but experts encourage organizations not to wait to think about compliance until formal requirements are in force. At EY, for example, \"we're engaging with our clients to get ahead of it,\" Barrington said. Otherwise, businesses could find themselves playing catch-up when regulations do come into effect. Beyond the ripple effects of European policy, recent activity in the U.S. executive branch also suggests how AI regulation could play out stateside. President Joe Biden's October executive order implemented new mandates, such as requiring AI developers to share safety test results with the U.S. government and imposing restrictions to protect against the risks of AI in engineering dangerous biological materials. Various federal agencies have also issued guidance targeting specific sectors, such as NIST's AI Risk Management Framework and the Federal Trade Commission's statement warning businesses against making false claims about their products' AI use. Further complicating matters, 2024 is an election year in the U.S., and the current slate of presidential candidates shows a wide range of positions on tech policy questions . A new administration could theoretically change the executive branch's approach to AI oversight through reversing or revising Biden's executive order and nonbinding agency guidance.

The market winners Last year, generative AI (genAI) was the primary driver advancing the understanding and widespread application of AI among the public. The interactive nature of genAI, especially in conversations, had a profound impact, making its practical use accessible to individuals in the workplace and beyond. Historically, the tech sector had the highest engagement with AI tools, but the latest McKinsey Global Survey confirms the integration of genAI into various other sectors. According to the study, 70% of business professionals have engaged with genAI at work or personally, with 22% utilizing it daily [1]. Furthermore, executives foresee it becoming a prominent component of board agendas across industries in the years ahead. Now, let's explore the winners that benefited most from genAI adoption over the past year. As explored in a previous article, AI enterprise tools , the adage “if you build it, they will come” resonates well with the success of infrastructure vendors that provide the foundation for large language models (LLMs), which are cornerstones in the training of genAI. Among the prominent industry leaders capitalizing on the escalating demand for computing power necessary to scale genAI are key players in both software and hardware. These include: Cloud infrastructure : Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are pivotal in establishing the groundwork for AI infrastructure. Notably, “more than half of all funded genAI startups are Google Cloud customers, including 70% of all genAI “Unicorns,” or those valued at more than $1 Billion [2].” GPU infrastructure : Producers of graphic processing units (GPU), such as NVIDIA, which controls 80% of the GPU market [3], have experienced increased valuations and surging demand because of genAI. GPU chips play a pivotal role in enhancing overall performance for genAI applications, underscoring their significance for future advancements. Defining AI trends for 2023 Amid the myriad of AI trends and themes that characterized 2023, four major themes emerged, shaping the narrative and capturing widespread attention: Business adoption : Although consumer genAI applications grabbed headlines, 2023 also saw increased business experimentation. Enterprise adoption, startup activity and the proliferation of AI systems modeled after ChatGPT highlighted the rapid expansion of general-purpose AI applications. Understanding reasoning : While terms like genAI grabbed mainstream headlines, the mechanics of AI remained a “black box” for many. The crucial question persists: How can we trust AI outputs beyond issues of bias or \"hallucinations\"? Interestingly, \"hallucinate\" was named the Cambridge Dictionary’s word of the year in AI-related updates, now encompassing instances where artificial intelligence produces false information. Weighing societal risks : The landscape of how AI is reshaping work has left many uncertain about the future of employment. Simultaneously, global AI leaders signed a petition advocating a pause in AI development due to existential risks to humans. Amid these developments, concerns have also risen regarding the undetermined environmental impact tied to the expanding use of genAI. Emerging governance : AI regulation emerged as a major talking point at both micro and macro levels. Notably, the US Senate, White House and other influential entities continue to contribute to the dialogue, mainly focusing on responsible use, security and the development of AI. Concurrently, complex legal issues such as copyright, plagiarism and content ownership spurred lawsuits that are only beginning to intensify. What to expect in 2024 and beyond As 2023 concluded, many experts, publications and leaders expressed their AI predictions for 2024 and beyond. This includes insights from various sources such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), which featured global leaders’ perspectives and predictions from research experts at IBM, Gartner, Forrester and MIT, among others. Explore four key takeaways from these predictions: Focused AI implementation : In 2023, most companies experimented with open-source AI models trained on massive datasets, adopting genAI in limited ways. In 2024, companies will shift their focus to implementing AI optimized for task-specific solutions. Organizations will focus on training models extensively on niche, proprietary data closely aligned with core business needs, enabling the deployment of AI that delivers targeted value. Bring your own AI (BYOAI) : As AI becomes more accessible to individuals, employees eager to boost productivity often adopt AI tools without organizational approval. According to Forrester, the \"bring your own AI\" trend will accelerate as companies struggle to fulfill employee demand amidst data security concerns. Consequently, organizations will grapple with managing the widespread use of \"shadow\" AI, AI unauthorized by official policy. While employees bypass security to utilize personal AI, companies face difficult tradeoffs balancing productivity, data risk and policy control. AI goes multimodal : Commercial use of genAI predominantly relied on text-based models with some integration of visual and video for data insights. However, 2024 will witness the rise of multimodal models that seamlessly integrate text, speech and vision, fostering innovative use cases across diverse sectors and enhancing individual and business productivity. Emerging threats : As AI advances, governing bodies could find it challenging to stay current with novel threats. The WEF’s Global Risks Report 2024 identified misinformation and disinformation as their top short-term threats of 2024, encompassing risks such as deepfake videos, voice cloning and the production of counterfeit content. Furthermore, as AI becomes more deeply integrated into our daily lives, concerns about the safety and ethics surrounding our personal data will continue to deepen. Looking forward As we reflect on AI's evolution in 2023 and anticipate its trajectory into 2024 and beyond, one certainty remains: change will continue to occur, and fast.
