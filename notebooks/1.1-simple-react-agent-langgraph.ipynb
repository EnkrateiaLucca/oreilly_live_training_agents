(\\\\\"\\'Waffles\\' is only comedy silver,\\\\\" he added.) We are reading The Complete Cul de Sac at bedtime now, having long since read and reread all the various collections of Cul de Sac strips. [...] Was John Locke trying to be funny? \\\\\"Pancakes\\\\\" is funny, and the idea of John Locke, the great philosopher, recording his recipe for pancakes is funny, but the real surprise and enjoyment in the recipe comes at the conclusion—the punchline?—in which Locke declares, simply and certainly, \\\\\"This is the right way.\\\\\" [...] Personally, from my point of view, I don\\'t have a right way to cook pancakes. Where John Locke wrote his recipe neatly in ink, I have an index card on which I wrote down multiple columns of measurements as I tabbed from one online recipe to another to another. It\\'s possible I did this twice and have two cards. On the infrequent occasions I decide to try to make pancakes, I glance at the different quantities in the different columns, come up with a general vibe, and try it out. This approach works OK, mostly.

I had noticed how oily the first set of pancakes turned out and that was not exactly the most pleasant thing to look at nor eat. My second solution was to add more flour. My pancake mix was too watery and at that point, whatever came out of the pan could not be considered pancakes. I realized how this process reminded me of everything I have ever learnt about moderation, how nothing will turn out right if something in the mix was too little or too much. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?Subsequently, I noticed how the newer sets of pancakes turned out better than the last. The more attempts I made, the better the turn-out.

Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake--Pancakes!

However, manuscripts from the Bodleian Library (Oxford) reveal Locke’s own handwritten pancake recipe. The recipe, which features rich flavors like nutmeg and orange blossom water, does not merely indicate Locke’s gustatory preferences; rather, it embodies his empirical attitude and belief in practical knowledge. Locke’s succinct endorsement—“This is the right way”—reflects his pursuit of methodical certainty, a key tenet across his philosophical works, from epistemology to political conduct.\\\\n\\\\nLocke’s pancake recipe, therefore, becomes more than instructions for breakfast.
