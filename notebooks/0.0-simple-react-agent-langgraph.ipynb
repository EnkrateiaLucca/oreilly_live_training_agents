(\\\\\"\\'Waffles\\' is only comedy silver,\\\\\" he added.) We are reading The Complete Cul de Sac at bedtime now, having long since read and reread all the various collections of Cul de Sac strips. [...] Was John Locke trying to be funny? \\\\\"Pancakes\\\\\" is funny, and the idea of John Locke, the great philosopher, recording his recipe for pancakes is funny, but the real surprise and enjoyment in the recipe comes at the conclusion—the punchline?—in which Locke declares, simply and certainly, \\\\\"This is the right way.\\\\\" [...] Personally, from my point of view, I don\\'t have a right way to cook pancakes. Where John Locke wrote his recipe neatly in ink, I have an index card on which I wrote down multiple columns of measurements as I tabbed from one online recipe to another to another. It\\'s possible I did this twice and have two cards. On the infrequent occasions I decide to try to make pancakes, I glance at the different quantities in the different columns, come up with a general vibe, and try it out.
